     <p>"Marble Palace" at 280 Broadway</p>
     <p>A CENTURY and a half ago, A. T. Stewart innovated a new kind of store. He built his "marble palace", the first department store in New York and perhaps the nation, on the east side of Broadway from Chambers to Reade Street. Since then, many iconic department stores were developed in NYC. Here are some of the department stores you don't want to miss when you visit NYC!</p>

    <h2><a href="www.google.com">Saks Fifth Avenue</a></h2>
    <p>In 1924, cousins Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel had just opened a shiny new retail store that had an entire block of frontage on Fifth Avenue. Saks was the first New York department store to formalize the idea of window displays.</p>

    <h2><a href="www.google.com">Barneys New York</a></h2>

    <h2><a href="www.google.com">Henri Bendel</a></h2>
    <p>Founded in 1913 in Greenwich Village by Louisiana-born milliner Henri Bendel. He boldly registered his own trademark and developed the signature brown-and-white striped hat box and bag that define the brand today. The store in the Upper East Side was brought about by retail magnate Leslie Wexner.</p>

    <h2><a href="www.google.com">Macy’s</a></h2>
    <p>First founded in 1858 as a small dry-goods shop on the corner of 14th St and 6th Ave by Rowland Hussey Macy, it was then moved to 34th St and Broadway in 1902. In 1931 the store was extended to its new 7th Ave building. Macy’s anchors Herald Square as the world’s largest store.</p>

    <h2><a href="www.google.com">Bergdorf Goodman</a></h2>
    <p>Herman Bergdorf, an immigrant from France, opened a tailor shop and took 25-year-old New Yorker Edwin Goodman as his apprentice. In 1928, after Bergdorf retired to Paris, Goodman built the handsome marble-faced Beaux Arts structure on 58th St. Soon Goodman was able to purchase the entire block, further expanding his store. </p>
